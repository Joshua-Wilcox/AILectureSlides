# AI Lecture Slides (COMP2321)

A centralized hub for the **COMP2321: Artificial Intelligence** module lecture slides and notes.

## Why this exists?

> **The Problem:** The current module resources are scattered across different platforms and weeks, making it difficult to find specific slides or get a holistic view of the course content. Our module team doesn't have lecture slides all in one place.

> **The Solution:** This application aggregates all lecture materials into a single, easy-to-navigate timeline, ensuring you have everything you need for revision and study in one accessible location.

## Features

- **Timeline View**: A chronological list of all lectures, topics, and descriptions.
- **Direct Access**: Quick links to view individual lecture slides (PDF/PPTX) and reading materials.
- **Aggregated Notes**: A massive single PDF containing all my lecture notes for the course so far, available for preview and download.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For the UI library.
- **Vite**: For fast tooling and build process.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the specific "Dark Academia" look.
